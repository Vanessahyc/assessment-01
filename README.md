## Description
- I create a div wrapper to wrap two main div and use display flex.
- I separated the page into two div box in the homepage index.js
- The left div contain the SideNavigation component.
- Inside the SideNavigation I have call MenuItem component to resue it.
- The right div contain Header, Card, and Footer component.
- For Header Component, I used display flex and space-between to separate them.
- Inside the homepage index.js I have call Card component to reuse it.
- I wrape two card component in a div, totoal is 3 big div. I used display flex and space-evenly for each div.
- I include the Header and Footer in the main tag, so when I use display flex the Header component can show on the right side. The reason I include the Footer inside main tag is to avoid the extra space for border-right.
